
NOTE 1 : The sample file for ASSERTION is network.txt events.txt
NOTE 2 : networkTS1b.txt, eventsTS1.txt, eventsTS1b.txt will only operate in normal interactive or simulation
- To run the program use the command "java SocialSim -i" for interactive mode or "java SocialSim -s network.txt events.txt like_probability follow_probability "
- s: simulation mode the program will run using the provided data from file and save the result to a file call save.txt
- i: the program will operate in interactive mode which show a menu like below
1. Load Network. 
2. Set probabilities 
3. Node operations (find, delete, insert) 
	3.1 find 
	3.2 delete 
	3.3	insert 	
4. Edge operations (like / follow - add , remove)
	4.1 add like / follow 
	4.2 remove like / follow	
5. New Post (state / events )
6. Display network 
7. Display statistics
	7.1 post in order of popularity 
	7.2 show people in popularity order
	7.3 Show a person record 
8. Update (run a timestep) (1 step at a time when there new post)
9. Save Network	(save graph) 

-- extra functions --

10. Print graph Edge
11. Print specific vertex Edge
15. Exit -work
